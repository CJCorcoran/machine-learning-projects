This binary classification project determines whether or not, based on 13 medical attributes, a patient may have heart disease.

Achieved an accuracy of close to 85% with logistic regression model that was cross-validated.  The sex (being male), Thalassemia diagnosis, and the outcome of fluoroscopy characterization are the biggest predictors for heart disease in a patient.

Possible ways to improve improve model:
    
      1. Collect more data (<300 pts): Data is heavily skewed w/ older males having heart disease and having 
          a greater sample set might improve the model and outcome.
    2. Improve current model with even more fine tuning
