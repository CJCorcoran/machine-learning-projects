# Heart Disease Prediction with a Machine Learning/Deep Learning Models

This binary classification project determines whether or not, based on 13 medical attributes, a patient may have heart disease.

I was able to achieve a cross-validated accuracy of close to 84% with logistic regression. A simple deep learning model -- as a quick sanity check -- was also employed to obtain an accuracy of 86.6%. The biggest predictors for heart disease were the patient's maximum heart rate during investigation, Thalassemia diagnosis, and the outcome of fluoroscopy characterization.

Possible ways to improve improve model:
   
1. Collect more data (<300 pts): Data is heavily skewed w/ older males having heart disease and having a greater sample set might improve the model and outcome.
2. Improve current model with even more fine tuning; this is highly unlikely to improve significantly given the results of our deep learning model.
