# Time-series forecasting the SP 500

This notebook will use a few simple neural networks to predict the future price of the SP500.  Using a simple model, the accuracy of our price prediction could only be improved by ~1% relative to the baseline.  (The baseline used is the previous day's closing price.)  Price prediction, such as for stocks, is extremely difficult based upon the [efficent market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis).  The purpose, therefore, of this notebook is a demonstration of timeseries forecasting using machine learning.  I will show predictions from data going to June 2022.  I will also show a machine learning model could not predict Black Monday, when the SP500 fell by 20% in a single day.  A model cannot predict anything in the future outside of the distribution of data used for training. Therefore, larger, unexpected price movements upward or downward will likely never be part of a forecast. If included, the forecast would, therefore, become noiser in terms of the predictions.
