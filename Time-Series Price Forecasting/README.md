# Time Series Forecasting of the SP 500

There are a ton of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neural+network+stock+price) and [articles](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=neural+network+stock+price) dedicated to using nerual networks for stock price predition.  I intend to show that, while the results from these models can look compelling, they need to be taken with a ton of skepticism.

This notebook will use a few simple neural networks to predict the future price of the SP500.  From these models, the price prediction accuracy only improved by ~1% relative to the baseline.  (The baseline for predicted price was the previous day's closing price.)  Price prediction, such as for stocks, is extremely difficult based upon the [efficent market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis).  The purpose, therefore, of this notebook is a demonstration of time series forecasting using machine learning; splitting the data into train and test sets, window the data, creating models, and evaluating them; and also to show how unreliable the predicted results can be for such complex, open systems.  I will show predictions from data going to June 2022.  I will also show a machine learning model could not predict Black Monday, when the SP500 fell by 20% in a single day.
