# Dog Breed Classifier

This notebook builds a multi-class image classifier, based upon a [Kaggle competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data), to determine the breed of a dog based upon 120 breeds.  By using transfer learning via TensorFlow Hub's builtin model set, the InceptionV3 model was able to achieve a multi-class log loss value of about 20.  (Note: Per the competition guidelines, multi-class log loss values are computeted by Kaggle and a lower value means higher accuracy.)  After employing data augmentation on the images, as well as fine-tuning the model's last 20 layers, the multi-class log loss value dropped to 0.943.
